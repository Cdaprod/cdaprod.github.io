Here are the steps to follow after setting up Jekyll with GitHub Pages and completing the initial configurations:

1. **Choose a theme or design**: Research and choose a Jekyll theme that you like or design a custom layout for your blog. Consider aspects such as colors, typography, and general appearance.

2. **Create custom layouts**: Based on your chosen theme or design, create custom layouts for your blog, such as a home page, post layout, and archive layout. You can do this by creating new files in the `_layouts` directory and using the appropriate HTML, CSS, and Liquid syntax.

3. **Style your blog**: Create or modify the CSS for your blog to match your chosen theme or design. You can use plain CSS, SCSS, or a CSS framework like Bootstrap or TailwindCSS. Store your stylesheets in the `assets/css` directory.

4. **Create navigation**: Design and implement a navigation menu for your blog. This can include links to your home page, about page, blog archive, and any other relevant pages. Add the navigation menu to your main layout file (e.g., `default.html`) using HTML and Liquid syntax.

5. **Add an about page**: Create an `about.md` file in your repository's root directory and write a brief introduction about yourself and your blog. Make sure to include the front matter with the appropriate layout (e.g., `layout: default`).

6. **Implement pagination**: If you expect to have many blog posts, consider implementing pagination for your blog's home page or archive page. This can be done using Jekyll's built-in pagination support or a plugin like `jekyll-paginate-v2`.

7. **Optimize images**: If your blog includes images, make sure to optimize them for the web. This can be done using image compression tools or services to reduce file sizes without significantly affecting image quality.

8. **Set up an RSS feed**: Create an RSS feed for your blog so that readers can subscribe to your content. This can be done using Jekyll's built-in RSS support or a plugin like `jekyll-feed`.

9. **Test your blog**: Ensure your blog works correctly on different devices, browsers, and screen sizes. Test the responsiveness, performance, and accessibility of your blog.

10. **Commit and push changes**: As you make changes and improvements to your blog, commit and push them to your GitHub repository. This will trigger GitHub Pages to build and deploy your updated site.

After completing these steps and having a well-designed, functional blog, you can create a submodule for your Jekyll blog inside your monorepo's `apps/` directory. Here's how to do that:

1. Navigate to your monorepo's `apps/` directory in the terminal or command prompt.

2. Run the following command to add your Jekyll blog as a submodule:

   ```
   git submodule add https://github.com/your-username/your-username.github.io.git your-blog-folder-name
   ```

   Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username and `your-blog-folder-name` with the desired folder name for the submodule.

3. Git will create a `.gitmodules` file in your monorepo, which keeps track of your submodules. Commit and push these changes to your monorepo:

   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Added Jekyll blog as a submodule"
   git push
   ```

Now, your Jekyll blog is included as a submodule in your monorepo's `apps/` directory.
